## Tech Decisions
### Frameworks
1. React.js
  - Faster load times for viewers of blog

## Naming

### Github Workflow
1. Always branch off of *most recent* master
  - Please note that you must switch back to master before branching between tasks
2. Merge conflicts *must* involve everyone whose code is involved.
3. Branch naming. Please prefix github username and suffix (separated by hyphens) a brief task name.
  `<githubusername>-<task-title>`
4. If your team created a PR you have to have the OTHER team merge it.

### CSS
Prefer classes over other selector in conjunction with BEM.
`.Block__element--modifier`

### JS
1. File names
  - First letter always capitol
  `Main.js`
2. Variable names
  - Use `el` as suffix when reference to DOM element is created
  - Use `$` as prefix when referencing variables that use jQuery
3. Method names
  - Event handlers should have `handler` as suffix and `on` as prefix
4. Selecting/referencing elements in the DOM
  - Prefer to use `ref='elementName'` over `$` or `document` selectors to match React conventions
